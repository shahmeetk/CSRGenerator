- **Flexible Deployment**: Easy to deploy and use

## üåü Features

- **CSR Generation**: Create CSRs for different services and environments
- **CSR Validation**: Validate existing CSRs for correctness

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Hosting Options**:
  - Any static hosting for frontend
  - Any Python hosting for backend

## üöÄ Running Locally

To run the application locally, follow the instructions in the "Getting Started" section below.

## üíª Use Cases

### For Security Teams

- Generate CSRs following security best practices
- Validate CSRs against security policies

### For System Administrators

- Quickly generate CSRs for multiple services
- Ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments

### For DevOps Engineers

- Integrate CSR generation into CI/CD pipelines
- Validate CSRs as part of your workflow

## üìã Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- bash (for running the scripts)

### üîß Installation

**Step 1:** Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSRGenerator.git
cd CSRGenerator
```

**Step 2:** Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x run_local.sh run_tests.sh
```

**Step 3:** Run the application:

```bash
./run_local.sh
```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers.

**Step 4:** Run the tests:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## üìù API Endpoints

Once the backend is running, you can access the following API endpoints:

- Health Check: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
- Generate CSR: [http://localhost:8000/generate](http://localhost:8000/generate) (POST)
- Validate CSR: [http://localhost:8000/validate](http://localhost:8000/validate) (POST)

## üö¢ Deployment

You can deploy the application to any hosting service that supports React and Flask applications.

### Option 1: Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSRGenerator.git
cd CSRGenerator

# Run the local development script
./run_local.sh
```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
